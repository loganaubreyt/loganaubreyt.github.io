 <h1> The Penultimate Chiptole Bowl Collection </h1>
</header>

<main class="main-container">
    <a> Calling all burrito bowl enthusiasts and interestees! I am diving headfirst into the world of Chipotle bowl orders to unearth the best bowl combinations, one order at a time. It's going to be a journey into the heart of our collective taste buds in a totally unbiased and not at all subjective ranking system. </a>       
    <a> Now, let's talk vibes here - this project is a mashup of academic entanglement and a love for good eats, but it is also an interactive experience! 
        That's right! As the viewer, you can suggest bowls to try, and if they seem interesting enough, we'll rate them on the website! So, who's ready to spice up this journey with me? 
    </a>

    <a> Click "Bowls" in the navigation tab to view our current collection, or go to "Submit" to add your own bowl to the list. If we like it, we'll add it to the website!
